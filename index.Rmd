## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load libaries}
library(base)
library(dplyr)
library(jsonlite)
library(forcats)
library(ggplot2)
library(graphics)
library(grDevices)
library(httr)
library(kableExtra)
library(methods)
library(purrr)
library(readr)
library(stats)
library(tibble)
library(tidyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(yaml)
