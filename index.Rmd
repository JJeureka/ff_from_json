## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load libaries}
library(base)
library(dplyr)
library(jsonlite)
library(forcats)
library(ggplot2)
library(graphics)
library(grDevices)
library(httr)
library(kableExtra)
library(methods)
library(purrr)
library(readr)
library(stats)
library(tibble)
library(tidyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(yaml)



```

```{r get API}


url <- "https://lm-api-reads.fantasy.espn.com/apis/v3/games/FFL/leagueHistory/533712?view=mMatchupScore&view=mStatus&view=mSettings&view=mTeam&view=modular&view=mNav&seasonId=2023"


```


```{r get Json}

all_crew_data <- fromJSON(url)

```


```{r get Members from JSON}

#pulls just the members list from the entire data set
members_crew_data <- all_crew_data$members

#this pulls the data from out of the list - this is good to go
members_crew_data_1 <- members_crew_data[[1]]

```



```{r get Teams from JSON}

#pulls just the teams list from the entire data set
teams_crew_data <- all_crew_data$teams

#this pulls the data frame out of the list - this still has nested data so we will need to unnest after joining
teams_crew_data_1 <- teams_crew_data[[1]]

```




```{r joining members and teams on members.id and teams.primaryOwner}

result <- inner_join(members_crew_data_1, teams_crew_data_1, by = c("id" = "primaryOwner"))

```


```{r unnest record$overall from joined dataset}

result_unnested_record <- result %>%
     unnest(cols = c(record))

result_unnested_overall <- result_unnested_record %>%
     unnest(cols = c(overall))

View(result_unnested_overall)


```


```{r select only the columns we want}

final_crew_data <- result_unnested_overall %>%
   select(displayName, firstName, points, pointsFor, pointsAgainst, id, owners)

View(final_crew_data)

```


```{r can we just put this in here?}
summary_table <- final_crew_data %>%
  group_by(firstName) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_points_against = round(mean(pointsAgainst), 2),
    avg_points_for = round(mean(pointsFor), 2)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_points_for))

# Rename columns for readability
summary_table <- summary_table %>%
  rename(
    `Team Name` = firstName,
    `Points Against` = avg_points_against,
    `Points For` = avg_points_for
  )

# Display the table with kable and kableExtra with custom width
summary_table <- kable(summary_table, 
      caption = "Points For and Against in 2023", 
      align = c("l", "c", "c")) %>%
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),
    full_width = TRUE, # Set to TRUE to make the table wider
    position = "center"
  ) %>%
  column_spec(1, width = "15em") %>%   
  column_spec(2, width = "15em") %>%  
  column_spec(3, width = "15em") %>%  # 
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#4CAF50", extra_css = "padding: 20px;")

summary_table
```



## Including Plots


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```


```{r json blob}

library(jsonlite)
json_data <- '{
  "league": {
    "league_id": 12345,
    "season": 2023,
    "teams": [
      {
        "team_id": 1,
        "team_name": "The Crushers",
        "owner": {
          "name": "John Doe",
          "email": "john@example.com"
        },
        "players": [
          {
            "player_id": 101,
            "name": "Patrick Mahomes",
            "position": "QB",
            "points": 250
          },
          {
            "player_id": 102,
            "name": "Derrick Henry",
            "position": "RB",
            "points": 200
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "team_id": 2,
        "team_name": "The Destroyers",
        "owner": {
          "name": "Jane Smith",
          "email": "jane@example.com"
        },
        "players": [
          {
            "player_id": 103,
            "name": "Josh Allen",
            "position": "QB",
            "points": 260
          },
          {
            "player_id": 104,
            "name": "Dalvin Cook",
            "position": "RB",
            "points": 190
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}'

parsed_data <- fromJSON(json_data)



```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
